### Set up your virtual environment
- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Import 'environment.yml' (in the same folder as 'README.md'), e.g. with Anaconda Navigator -> Environments -> Import
- Start -> Anaconda Powershell Prompt -> typ: "conda activate environment" (in case 'environment' is the name of the environment you just imported)
- Next, still in Anaconda Powershell Prompt, typ: "jupyter notebook", in order to open jupyter notebook.

### Run the notebooks to test the project
- You can find the notebooks in the subfolder 'notebooks' of the project folder.
- The notebooks use scripts from the folder 'scripts'.
- The notebook 'input_to_output' turns the input files (in the folder data\input) into intermediate files (in the folder data\output)

### The scripts that are used by the notebook:
- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.py is a script with functions that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 
- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.py is a script with functions that XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 

### Problems with running the notebook? To get an idea of what we did, you can take a look at:
- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX An HTML file of the notebooks in the folder 'notebooks'
- Our output files in the folder 'data\output'
- The scripts in the folder 'scripts'. We provided each function with a clear docstring.
- In case something isn't clear: contact us via email.

### You can ignore the folder '.idea'
- I used Pycharm to program, and Pycharm created this folder.

We are happy to receive your feedback!

Carlo, Raf and Yannick
